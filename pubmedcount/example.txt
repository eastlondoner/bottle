TI  - Opioid-induced respiratory depression: ABCB1 transporter pharmacogenetics.
LID - 10.1038/tpj.2014.56 [doi]
AB  - Opioid-related respiratory depression (RD) is a serious clinical problem as it
      causes multiple deaths and anoxic brain injuries. Morphine is subject to efflux
      via P-glycoprotein transporter encoded by ABCB1, also known as MDR1. ABCB1
      polymorphisms may affect blood-brain barrier transport of morphine and therefore
      individual response to its central analgesic and adverse effects. This study
      aimed to determine specific associations between common ABCB1 genetic variants
      and clinically important outcomes including RD and RD resulting in prolonged stay
      in hospital with intravenous morphine in a homogenous pediatric surgical pain
      population of 263 children undergoing tonsillectomy. Children with GG and GA
      genotypes of ABCB1 polymorphism rs9282564 had higher risks of RD resulting in
      prolonged hospital stays; adding one copy of the minor allele (G) increased the
      odds of prolonged hospital stay due to postoperative RD by 4.7-fold (95%
      confidence interval: 2.1-10.8, P=0.0002).The Pharmacogenomics Journal advance

TI  - Pharmacogenetics of erectile dysfunction: navigating into uncharted waters.
PG  - 1519-38
LID - 10.2217/pgs.14.110 [doi]
AB  - Sildenafil and other PDE-5 inhibitors have revolutionized erectile dysfunction
      (ED) treatment. However, a significant number of patients do not respond or
      present adverse reactions to these drugs. While genetic polymorphisms may
      underlie this phenomenon, very little research has been undertaken in this
      research field. Most of the current knowledge is based on sildenafil, thus almost
      completely ignoring other important pharmacological therapies. Currently, the
      most promising genes with pharmacogenetic implications in ED are related to the
      nitric oxide and cGMP pathway, although other genes are likely to affect the
      responsiveness to treatment of ED. Nevertheless, the small number of studies
      available opens the possibility of further exploring other genes and phenotypes
      related to ED. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the genes being
      tested for their pharmacogenetic relevance in the therapy of ED.

TI  - From pharmacogenetics to pharmacometabolomics: SAM modulates TPMT activity.
PG  - 1437-49
LID - 10.2217/pgs.14.84 [doi]
AB  - AIM: In the present study, the influence of SAM on TPMT activity in vivo on human
      subjects was investigated. SUBJECTS & METHODS: A total of 1017 donors from the
      Estonian Genome Center of the University of Tartu (Estonia) were genotyped for
      common TPMT variants, evaluated for TPMT activity, SAM levels, a set of 19
      biochemical and ten hematological parameters and demographic data. RESULTS: After
      adjustment in multiple regression models and correction for multiple testing,
      from the 43 factors that were tested, only TPMT genotype (p = 1 x 10(-13)) and
      SAM levels (p = 1 x 10(-13)) were found to significantly influence TPMT activity.
      The influence of SAM on TPMT activity was more pronounced in TPMT-heterozygous
      than wild-type individuals. CONCLUSION: SAM represents a potential
      pharmacometabolomic marker and therapeutic agent in TPMT-heterozygous subjects.
